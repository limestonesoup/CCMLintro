
In both the notebooks the level headings are a bit haphazard in order
based on personal coding logic: but they are all labeled.

the rest of the structure is pretty intuitive.

i actually dont know how to write documentation.

anal1.ipynb is for CampusPulse (Task 1)
anal2.ipynb is for WeatherMind (Task 2)

in campus pulse there are a lot of graphs and easier code soo... ALSO Campus Pulse bonus task answers in PLEASEREAD_... file ... please read:

and in weathermind half of the code is just making the pretty graph for the weather the main mistral stuff and routing is simple
